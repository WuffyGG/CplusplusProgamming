# CplusplusProgamming

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This is a finance program that took the initial investment, the monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and the number of years
and calculated the balance and interest each year with or without monthly deposits.

# What did you do particularly well?
Having the idea of each function in the class and what it does so I can create the entire project.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I can enchance my code by making a function to print out each symbol on the menu so the menu can be updated to look cleaner and be more efficient.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most difficult code to write was some of the functions. I used resources from my C++ learning book to find the right code to use for the different functions.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Skills of making classes and function using C++ to be used over on other C++ projects.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintanable, readable and adaptable by using comments and using spacing. I also separated everything by classes with private and public functions
so everything is organized.
